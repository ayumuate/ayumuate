Hi, there! I'm **@ayumuate** or **Dysphoric Ayumuate （不安步根）**, a 18-year-old mundane student leading a mundane life in a mundane high school.

**Dysphoric** is the adjective form of *dysphoria*, meaning a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction[^dysphoria].

**Ayumaute** consists of two parts:

* **Ayumu** Ayumu Sakura, the heroine of the manga 「おじさんが女子●生に悪いことを教える話」 ([*A Story About an Old Man Teaches Bad Things to a School Girl*](https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/ua920785/chapter_1)[^vpn]). Despite an NSFW name, it's actually a very attractive manga.
* **-ate** The suffix for esters (e.g. sulfate)[^ate].
