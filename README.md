Hi, there! I'm **@ayumuate** or **Dysphoric Ayumuate （不安步根）**, a 19-year-old mundane student leading a mundane life after graduation of high school.

Not proficient in anything —which you can find since there's no repo—, not outgoing or social whatsoever, not looking cute or cool, I'm nothing but nobody in the vast cosmos, awaiting your random discovery.

I am what I belong to, not what others assigned to me wrongly. Having been *dysphoric* as what I had disguised as, I am sure it's time to come out and live what I actually am.

**Dysphoric** is the adjective form of *dysphoria*, meaning a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction[^dysphoria].

**Ayumuate** consists of two parts:

* **Ayumu** Ayumu Sakura, the heroine of the manga 「おじさんが女子●生に悪いことを教える話」 ([*A Story About an Old Man Teaches Bad Things to a School Girl*](https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/ua920785/chapter_1)[^vpn]). Despite an NSFW name, it's actually a very attractive manga. Interestingly, a femboy named Ayumu showed up in 「AYUMU ちょろい男の娘のおはなし」 ([Choroi Otokonoko no Ohanashi](https://mangakakalot.com/manga/yo929441)[^vpn]).
* **-ate** The suffix for esters (e.g. sulfate)[^ate].
