Hi, there! I'm @ayumuate or Dysphoric Ayumuate （不安步根）, a 17-year-old mundane student leading a mundane life in a mundane high school.

"Dysphoric" is the adjective form of *dysphoria*, meaning a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction[^dysphoria].

"Ayumaute" consists of two parts:

* **Ayumu** Ayumu Sakura, the heroine of the manga 「おじさんが女子●生に悪いことを教える話」 ([*A Story About An Old Man Teaches Bad Things to A School Girl*](https://mangakakalot.com/chapter/ua920785/chapter_1)[^vpn]). Despite an NSFW name, it's actually a very acctractive manga.
* **-ate** A suffix used when naming esters (e.g. sulfate)[^ate].
